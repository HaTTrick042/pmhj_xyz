If there were a solution, one might hope to reduce food waste, minimize frustration from 'quick store trips', and possible monetary savings.</p>

            <p><div class="section-header">Plan: </div>Create an android mobile solution that would include features such tracking of home pantry, meal/shopping suggestions based upon current pantry items, expiration/use-by-date tracking, etc.,</p>

            <p><div class="section-header">Team: </div>4 members, Sijin Chen (UI/UX Design), Harpreet Jaswal (Developer), Gabe Tran (Research/Videographer), Patrick Harper-Joles (PM)</p>

            <p><div class="section-header">Technology: </div>Android Studio Code, Illustrator</p>

            <p><div class="section-header">Mildly Interesting: </div>We filmed a number of promotional videos, and went through many many reshoots, to first illustrate our problem statement and then to show the world after our solution. It was a really fun process and the videos came out great!</p>

                <li>Designed to be useful through ease of non-use, the app passively sends alerts about food items without much user interaction</li>
                <li>Both educational and instructional, the app tracks your food but also suggests your meals adding value to your personal dataset</li>
                <li>Shopping lists resorted in novel ways, the app can organize your shopping list based upon the needs of specific recipes so you know exactly what you need and only that</li>
                <li>One scan entry method, GS1 coding can be found on many items within your local grocery store and not just on food, this coding allows the tracking of expiration dates, best by dates, and the best part is more than one item can be added to a single scan code!</li>
