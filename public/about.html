            <img src="img/hLine.png" id="header-line">
            <p>Upon completing high school in rural Southern Illinois, I worked with my father at a local restaurant until joining the US Army and traveling the world for nearly a decade. It was hard but rewarding work and I learned alot about leadership, and the limits of technology in harse environments, from various strong mentors along the way. Below is just a snippet of what I was doing during the mentioned timeframes but if you have questions please ask, I am always happy to talk about life experience. </p>

            <h2>(2005 - 2011) US Army</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2005, I joined the US Army as a Cavalry Scout. As soon as I finished basic training, I was sent to a unit for deployment to Iraq. Upon returning from Iraq, I retrained to become a Information Technology Specialist. Upon completing this training, I was transferred to a unit set for another deployment to Iraq. After I returned from this second deployment, I transferred to the Washington State National Guard from Fort Stewart, GA, while finishing my undergraduate classwork. </p><p>The move was hard, but a strong learning experience, as I had no family or friends in Washington State and almost solely focused on National Guard and class work while living alone in the Seattle area.</p>

            <h2>(2011 - 2014) Washington State National Guard</h2>
            <p>After leaving the Active US Army I pursued full time work with my unit while transitioning. I worked in many full-time spurts for my unit while simultaneously earning my undergraduate associate's degree. Upon completing my associate's, I applied to the University of Washington and was ecstatic to find I was accepted! After completing the necessary pre-requisite classes at UW, I applied to the Informatics major and was once again very happy to be accepted and ready to start moving my specialization forward. </p><p>Though being admitted to UW was one of the happiest days of my life, my entrance was bittersweet as right before my acceptance my father passed away. This was very difficult for me then, and continues to be for me to this day.</p>

            <h2>(2014 - 2016) University of Washington Informatics Student</h2>
            <p>The one resounding message that was repeated heavily within my time as an Informatics student was, "It Depends..". What is the best solution for this problem? It Depends.. What is the best technology to use? It Depends.. What is the best Informatics courseload? Well, that depends too.. Informatics offered a strong grounding in nearly all the basic industry technology standards and their uses so we could both ask and answer the question of "It Depends.." accurately and astutely. </p><p>There are many tools present in the Information and Computer Science fields, that sometimes just being aware is a blessing in and of itself, but thankfully our professors took pride in teaching us the reasonings and logic behind many of the prominent industries' correct steps, as well as their missteps and how to avoid them.</p>
